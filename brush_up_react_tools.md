## Create React App

Easiest way to get started with React. It comes in bundled with everything you need to start a React project without doing all the configuration grunt work.

Follow the steps from [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Dev Tools

This is a must have for debugging React. React dev tools allows you to traverse your components, look at their props and states in real time, give performance suggestions etc.

To learn more, visit their [blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/debug-react-applications-with-the-new-react-devtools/).

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a UI development environment for React components. It lets you develop and test React components interactively and you can also build your own component library. With Storybook, you can view the different states of each component and develop it in isolation from your app. 

## React Style guide generator

As the name suggests, you can use [React Style Guide Generator](https://github.com/pocotan001/react-styleguide-generator) tool to create a style guide for your app which will enforce consistency and reuse throughout your app. 

## Material UI

[React Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) is my favorite front end component library. Its modern, sleek and intuitive.
